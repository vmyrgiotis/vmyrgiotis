## About

Hi there! I am a research scientist at the [UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology](https://www.ceh.ac.uk). I have more than 12 years of experience in the development of data-driven computer models that describe biogeochemical processes in terrestrial/agricultural ecosystems. You can see my CV [here](cv.md) and examples of past and ongoing work below. 

My main research interests are :
* Agro-ecosystems
* Soil science and ecosystem biogeochemistry
* Computational data science
* Ecosystem modelling
* Earth observation and remote sensing 


## Work

### Grassland Modelling

DALEC-Grass is a simple process-based model that simulates carbon (C) dynamics in a temperate grassland ecosystems using 5 C pools: leaf, stem, roots, litter and soil organic C. C is assimilated into biomass via photosynthesis and allocated to the 5 C pools directly (biomass) or indirectly (soil). Vegetation removals can occur due to grazing or cutting. When grazing occurs the model quantifies how much of the grazed biomass-C returns to the soil as manure, is emitted a CO2 and CH4 and how much is stored in animal body. [DALEC-Grass](https://github.com/vmyrgiotis/DALEC_Grass) is written in fortran and can be compiled into a shared object for use in python. 

### Model Data Fusion 

<img src="mdf_dg.png" height="400px" width="700px">

Data fusion is the process of integrating multiple data sources to produce more consistent, accurate, and useful information than that provided by any individual data source. in Model-Data Fusion (MDF) one data stream includes model-simulated variables while other data streams can contain observations of system drivers (climate, soil conditions) and of system behaviour (plant growth). In ecosystem science, MDF refers to the use of earth observation and ground measured data on ecosystem functioning e.g. plant physiology, soil moisture/temperature, greenhouse gas fluxes etc.
