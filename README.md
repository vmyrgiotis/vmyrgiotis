## About

Hi there! I am a research scientist at the [UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology](https://www.ceh.ac.uk). I have more than 12 years of experience in the development of data-driven computer models that describe biogeochemical processes in terrestrial/agricultural ecosystems. You can see my CV [here](cv.md) and examples of past and ongoing work below. 

My main research interests are :
* Agro-ecosystems
* Soil science and ecosystem biogeochemistry
* Computational data science
* Ecosystem modelling
* Earth observation and remote sensing 


## Work

### Model Data Fusion

DALEC-Grass is a simple process-based model that simulates carbon (C) dynamics in a grassland ecosystem using 5 C poools: leaf, stem, roots, litter and soil organic C. C is allocated to the 5 C pools via NPP allocation (A) and litter production (L). Vegetation removals (VR) can occur due to grazing or cutting. When grazing occurs the model quantifies how much of the grazed biomass-C returns to the soil as manure, is emitted a CO2 and CH4 and how much is stored in  animal body.
