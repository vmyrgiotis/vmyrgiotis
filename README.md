## About

Hello there! My name is Vasilis and am a research scientist at the [UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology](https://www.ceh.ac.uk). I have more than 12 years of experience in the development of data-driven computer models that describe biogeochemical processes in terrestrial/agricultural ecosystems at scales that range from local to national. I also have a keen interest in ecosystem sensing technologies. You can see my CV [here](cv.md) and examples of past and ongoing work below. 

My main research interests are :
* Agro-ecosystems
* Soil science and ecosystem biogeochemistry
* Computational data science
* Ecosystem modelling
* Earth observation and remote sensing

### Grassland Modelling

<img src="https://github.com/vmyrgiotis/DALEC_Grass/blob/master/dalec_grass.gif" height="400px" width="500px">

DALEC-Grass is a simple process-based model that simulates carbon (C) dynamics in a temperate grassland ecosystems using 5 C pools: leaf, stem, roots, litter and soil organic C. C is assimilated into biomass via photosynthesis and allocated to the 5 C pools directly (biomass) or indirectly (soil). Vegetation removals can occur due to grazing or cutting. When grazing occurs the model quantifies how much of the grazed biomass-C returns to the soil as manure, is emitted a CO2 and CH4 and how much is stored in animal body. [DALEC-Grass](https://github.com/vmyrgiotis/DALEC_Grass) is written in fortran and can be compiled into a shared object for use in python.

<summary> Model Data Fusion  </summary>
  
### Model Data Fusion 

<img src="mdf_dg.png" height="400px" width="700px">

Data fusion is the process of integrating multiple data sources to produce more consistent, accurate, and useful information than that provided by any individual data source. in Model-Data Fusion (MDF) one data stream includes model-simulated variables while other data streams can contain observations of system drivers (climate, soil conditions) and of system behaviour (plant growth). In ecosystem science, MDF refers to the use of earth observation and ground measured data on ecosystem functioning e.g. plant physiology, soil moisture/temperature, greenhouse gas fluxes etc.

<summary> Soil Carbon Modelling </summary>
  
### Soil Carbon Modelling 

<img src="soilc.png" height="500px" width="600px">

Soil is a part of any terrestrial ecosystems that plays key role for the health and functioning of the ecosystem. Soil is also a critical carbon pool at global scale whose size exceeds the carbon stored in the atmosphere and vegetation combined. There exist many soil carbon models either as standalone models or modules of more comprehensive ecosystem scale models. This [repository](https://github.com/vmyrgiotis/soilCmodelling) includes python code and notebooks for implementing some widely-used soil carbon models available.
