## About

Hi there! I am a research scientist at the [UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology](https://www.ceh.ac.uk). I have more than 12 years of experience in the development of data-driven computer models that describe biogeochemical processes in terrestrial/agricultural ecosystems. You can see my CV [here](cv.md) and examples of past and ongoing work below. 

My main research interests are :
* Agro-ecosystems
* Soil science and ecosystem biogeochemistry
* Computational data science
* Ecosystem modelling
* Earth observation and remote sensing 


## Work

### Grassland Modelling

DALEC-Grass is a simple process-based model that simulates carbon (C) dynamics in a temperate grassland ecosystems using 5 C pools: leaf, stem, roots, litter and soil organic C. C is assimilated into biomass via photosynthesis and allocated to the 5 C pools directly (biomass) or indirectly (soil). Vegetation removals can occur due to grazing or cutting. When grazing occurs the model quantifies how much of the grazed biomass-C returns to the soil as manure, is emitted a CO2 and CH4 and how much is stored in animal body. [DALEC-Grass](https://github.com/vmyrgiotis/DALEC_Grass) is written in fortran and can be compiled into a shared object for use in python.
