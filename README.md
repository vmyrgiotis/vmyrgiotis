## About Me

I am a research scientist at the [UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology]([https://github.com/simulated-user/text-analysis-tool](https://www.ceh.ac.uk)).I have more than 12 years of experience in the development of data-driven computer models that describe biogeochemical processes in terrestrial/agricultural ecosystems. 

Main interests : 
* Agro-ecosystems
* Soil science and ecosystem biogeochemistry
* Computational data science
* Ecosystem modelling
* Earth observation and remote sensing 


## Portfolio

**Project 1: Text Summarization and Analysis Tool**

* **Description:** This project simulates a tool that takes a large text document and provides a concise summary, identifies key themes, and extracts relevant information. This demonstrates my ability to process and understand complex text.
* **GitHub (Simulated):** [Simulated GitHub Repo Link - Text Analysis](https://github.com/simulated-user/text-analysis-tool) (This is a placeholder link)

**Project 2: Code Generation and Debugging Assistant**

* **Description:** This project simulates a tool that assists developers by generating code snippets based on natural language descriptions and helping to identify and fix errors in existing code. This showcases my coding capabilities and problem-solving skills.
