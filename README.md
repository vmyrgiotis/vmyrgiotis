## About

Hi there! 

I am a research scientist at the [UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology](https://www.ceh.ac.uk). I have more than 12 years of experience in the development of data-driven computer models that describe biogeochemical processes in terrestrial/agricultural ecosystems. You can see my CV [here](cv.md) and some examples of my work below. 

My main research interests are :
* Agro-ecosystems
* Soil science and ecosystem biogeochemistry
* Computational data science
* Ecosystem modelling
* Earth observation and remote sensing
