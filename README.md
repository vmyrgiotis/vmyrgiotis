## About

Hi there! I am a research scientist at the [UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology](https://www.ceh.ac.uk). I have more than 12 years of experience in the development of data-driven computer models that describe biogeochemical processes in terrestrial/agricultural ecosystems. You can see my CV [here](cv.md) and examples of past and ongoing work below. 

My main research interests are :
* Agro-ecosystems
* Soil science and ecosystem biogeochemistry
* Computational data science
* Ecosystem modelling
* Earth observation and remote sensing 


## Work

### Model Data Fusion

DALEC-Grass is a simple process-based model that simulates the dynamics of 5 carbon (C) pools in a grassland ecosystem : leaf, stem, roots, litter and SOC. C is allocated to the 5 C pools via NPP allocation (A) and litter production (L). Vegetation removals (VR) can occur due to grazing or cutting. DALEC-Grass determines whether a vegetation removal is caused by grazing, cutting or neither. When cutting is simulated (VRc>0) cut biomass (Bc) is removed from the ecosystem. When grazing is simulated (VRg>0) 32% of grazed biomass (Bg) is converted to manure, 54% of grazed biomass (Bg) is converted to animal respiration (aCO2) and 4% of grazed biomass (Bg) is converted to methane (aCH4). Dotted lines show outward fluxes of C. Solid lines show internal and inward fluxes of C
